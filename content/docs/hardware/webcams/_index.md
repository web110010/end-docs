# Webcams

Setting up a webcam on Linux is easy.

In most cases, the device should be detected without any extra steps needed.

Check it:

`v4l2-ctl --list-devices`

needs [v4l-utils](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/v4l-utils/) installed

Per default you have at minimum two apps installed you can use to check how the webcam is working basically: **v4l2-view** ( a simple viewer) and **v4l2-test-bench** a qt-based config tool:

In most cases setting done here will get used if you use the cam in other applications like [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) or even zoom skype or other crap you have to use ðŸ˜‰

B.T.W if you need to use zoom Jitsi or skypeâ€¦ Before you go through all the hassle of installing it, try using the web app, itâ€™s usually easier and takes less effort.

Only to show some examplesâ€¦

There are a bunch of webcam clients/apps you can use on Linux on my testing a lot of them do not work properly, but I find GUVCView working smooth and without issues right out of the box.

And the app has both GTK and QT versions to choose from for installation:

`community/guvcview   Simple GTK+ interface for capturing and viewing video from v4l2 devices`

`community/guvcview-qt   Simple Qt interface for capturing and viewing video from v4l2 devices`

If you got any trouble or need some special setup the arch wiki will be the first read for you:
